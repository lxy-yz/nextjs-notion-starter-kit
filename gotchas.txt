1. filter view of database (posts) doesn't work https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit/issues/342
   cause: database with advanced filter not supported
   workaround: use tags

2. build timed out after n times https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/static-page-generation-timeout
   workaround: commented out code for feed generation
